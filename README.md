## Dish_Search

### This is a Django framework project. 
* This project includes reading data from a .csv file with massive data on restaurants in a city. 
* Stored all the data in the database from the .csv file, which is provided by Django as a default i.e, sqlite3
* I performed a search functionality based on the dish name and fetched all the restaurants and prices of the dish.
